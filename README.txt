This text file contains brief description of each file in the repository

Alt_gridprob.m: Matlab function takes in an altitude matrix altLandGrid (ususally generated by readshapealt) and returns a cells 2D-array where each cells contains the 9 elements array
containing the probabilities to move in any of the 9 neighborhood grid points corresponding to the position on altLandGrid determined by the cell array coordinates.
The function contained here to generate probabilities of movement from local altitudes is currently hard coded but can be changed or coded in separate function.
Current function based on difference from maximum altitude in the neighborhood. 
(can also return a landGrid cell 2D array with neighborhood altitudes instead of probabilities)

Alt_gridprob2.m: Matlab function takes in an altitude matrix altLandGrid (ususally generated by readshapealt) and returns a cells 2D-array where each cells contains the 9 elements array
containing the probabilities to move in any of the 9 neighborhood grid points corresponding to the position on altLandGrid determined by the cell array coordinates.
The function contained here to generate probabilities of movement from local altitudes is currently hard coded but can be changed or coded in separate function.
Current function based on difference from central (current) altitude in the neighborhood. 
(can also return a landGrid cell 2D array with neighborhood altitudes instead of probabilities)

altitudetest.sh: Submission script (use on ND CRC or similar) to use type2scriptalt.m. Provides altitudefile name and shapefile name.

flyPositioning.m: Matlab function used to populate the river areas with flies (randomly). Inputs coordinates of water grid points on landGrid matrix and the population to distribute. 
Outputs coordinates, gender, and genetic pool for each fly place on the grid (note: gender and genetic pool are currently not used).

flyrivertype1.m: Old version of main Matlab function for the project. This version simplifies the landGrid to 0s and 1s, indicating either land and water respectively,
 and assigns a weight for the probability of movement in the neighbrhood to each type. Inputs are gridType (Random, Fractal, or from shapefile), 
 pb= probability of birth per unit time (on river), pd= death probability per unit time, numberOfKids= number of offsprings, 
 simulationTimeLength= max length of simulation (unit time=hours),flyPopulationSize= initial population size, 
 nmoves= number of times a fly moves (changes 1 adjacent grid position) in a unit time.
 Output is saved to a Matlab data file ('.mat') cointaining the inputs and data on river, altitude, and flies at each time step (see end of described file for details).

flyrivertype2.m: New version of main Matlab function for the project. This version still uses a simplified landGrid to 0s and 1s, indicating either land and water respectively,
 used to determine if a fly is on water or land (for reproduction purpose).  If a altitude file is provided this version assigns a weight for the probability of movement 
 in the neighbrhood based on altitude data from a matrix altGrid. Inputs are gridType (Random, Fractal, or from shapefile, or from both shapefile and altitudefile), 
 pb= probability of birth per unit time (on river), pd= death probability per unit time, numberOfKids= number of offsprings, 
 simulationTimeLength= max length of simulation (unit time=hours),flyPopulationSize= initial population size, 
 nmoves= number of times a fly moves (changes 1 adjacent grid position) in a unit time.
  Output is saved to a Matlab data file ('.mat') cointaining the inputs and data on river, altitude, and flies at each time step (see end of described file for details).
  
gridprob.m: Matlab function takes in a matrix of 0s and 1s indicating land and water (ususally generated by readshapealt) and probability weights for both. Returns a cells 2D-array where each cells contains the 9 elements array
containing the probabilities to move in any of the 9 neighborhood grid points corresponding to the position on landGrid determined by the cell array coordinates.
Note this finction does not use altitudes to simulate movement of flies, only a boolean statement distinguishing between land and water. 

gridTestHammyJammy.m (Daniel, name to change): subfunction used to create landGrid when Random or Fractal rivers are selected in main code function (see flyrivertype1.m and riverCreation.m).

job.sh: Submission script (use on ND CRC or similar) to use type2script.m. Provides altitudefile name and shapefile name.

move_v3.m: Matlab function moves flies based on random number generation and probabilities provided to move in each of the 9 neighborhood slots. Takes inputs the current data on flies
(including positions), landGrid matrix, landGrid_prob probabilities, current population size, positions of the river, and timestep index. Returns new data on flies based on 
prescribed movement (also removes flies going out of bound and reports them as dead).

multibirthrate.sh: Submission script (use on ND CRC or similar) to use type3script.m. Allows to run multiple jobs with different birthrates in parallel.
 Provides altitudefile name, shapefile name, and birthrate given by task number.

plotscript.m: This script contains useful plot routines to display results of simulations. Note simulation data needs to be loaded before executing script.

plotsubpopareas.m: This script allows to plot data relative to subareas of the domaain.

README.txt: The file you are reading right now.

readshape2.m: Matlab Function reads in a shapefile and returns a landGrid matrix with 0s for land and 1s for water (can specify resolution of grid and buffer around the given region).

readshapealt.m: Matlab Function reads in a shapefile and returns a landGrid matrix with 0s for land and 1s for water (can specify resolution of grid and buffer around the given region).

readshapealtord.m: Matlab Function reads in a shapefile and altitude geotiff file and returns a landGrid matrix with 0s for land and 1s for water as well as a altGrid matrix with the altitudes.
In this function resolution is predetermined by the altitude file and buffer is set to 1 (no buffer). The geotiff region should fully contain the shapefile region (better if bigger)
and should use the same units for distance and geolocation coordinates.

readshape.m

riverCreation.m (Daniel): Matlab function to create landGrid space when Random or Fractal rivers are selected in main code function (see flyrivertype1.m and gridTestHammyJammy.m)
